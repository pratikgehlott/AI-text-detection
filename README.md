## Overview
**AI-Text-Detection** is a machine learning project focused on detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs). By leveraging models like RoBERTa, this project classifies text as either human-written or AI-generated, helping to identify synthetic content across platforms such as online forums and social media.

## Project Structure
- **dataset**: Contains datasets for training and testing, including text from Stack Overflow and Reddit, with both human-written and AI-generated examples.
- **spiders**: Scripts for scraping data from additional sources to enrich the dataset.
- **utils**: Helper functions for preprocessing and supporting model training.
- **paper_scripts**: Includes baseline machine learning models and scripts for feature extraction.
- **results**: Stores model evaluation metrics and checkpoints for analysis.

## Key Features
- **Text Classification**: Utilizes a RoBERTa-based model to classify text origin (human or AI).
- **Data Collection**: Gathers data from multiple sources for diverse and robust training.
- **Baseline Models**: Provides baseline models for performance comparison.
- **Customizable Preprocessing**: Modular scripts for data cleaning, tokenizing, and vectorizing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- Install required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Model
To train and evaluate the model, use:
```bash
python run.py
```

### Example Notebook
For an interactive walkthrough, see `roberta-classifier.ipynb`, which demonstrates model training, testing, and evaluation.

## Results
Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) are stored in the **results** folder, with each run organized by timestamp, including saved model weights for easy reproducibility.
